## How to use
first download models and save them in same directory with IPYNB file as jupyter notebooks then Run nootbooks.

### Model weights
Kaggle Drive Link:().

### Training and Testing
1) Download the face Brats-2021 dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dschettler8845/brats-2021-task1).
["Brats2020"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats2020-training-data).
["Brats2019"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/brain-tumor-segmentation-brats-2019).
["Brats2018"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanglequang/brats2018).

3) 2) Run the following code to install the Requirements.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4) Run the below code to train the Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and... as Encoder with this dataset.
5) 
Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and Strong cnn as  Encoder
Unet++ with ELU activision as Decoder and DenseNet 121 as  Encoder


6) Test trained model with this dataset in in IPYNB too.

## Results
Performance comparision on Brats-segmentation dataset.
